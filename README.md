# Hi, I'm Will Burns!

I'm a Software Engineer with a unique background in Literature. I have a PhD in Literature with a Creative Dissertation and a rich experience in teaching English at the university level. Recently, I've transitioned into the tech world, combining my storytelling skills with programming to create compelling and innovative software solutions.

## ðŸš€ Skills and Technologies
I have experience with a range of technologies in software development, particularly in full-stack web development.
